# SafeDrive
A driver drowsiness detection system built using a CNN model 

# The model is trained using the Transfer Learning technique in the domain of Deep Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task(i.e to retrain a pre-trained model).
There are various classifiers in Transfer learning namely MobileNet, GoogleNet, ResNet, VGG16 etc. 
In our project, we have used the MobileNet model.
MobileNet is a light-weighted model having fewer parameters compared to others.
